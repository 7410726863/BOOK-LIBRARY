# BOOK-LIBRARY
"A simple and efficient digital book library system for managing and organizing your book collection"

.HTML Structure: Provides a form to add books (bookForm), a search input field (searchInput), and 
 a container (bookList) to display books.

.CSS Styling: Styles the elements for better appearance and user experience.

JavaScript: Handles the logic for adding, displaying, searching, and deleting books. The library array acts as the in-memory storage for books.

usage:
   Open index.html in a web browser.
   Use the form to add books by filling in the details and clicking "Add Book".
   The added books will appear in the book list below.
   Use the search input to find books by title, author, or ISBN.
   Each book entry includes a "Delete" button to remove the book from the library.
   This implementation provides a basic framework for a digital book library system using HTML, 
   CSS, and JavaScript without requiring a backend server or database, making it simple and 
   efficient for managing and organizing your book collection.
